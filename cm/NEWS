Changes in version 0.4.2 ("Fitzebohnen"), released in May 2023:
  - If the environment variable CM_ECPP_TMPDIR is set, write checkpoint
    files during the second phase of ECPP while factoring class
    polynomials. This makes it possible to interrupt and restart the
    computation.

Changes in version 0.4.1 ("Fitzebohnen"), released in January 2023:
  - By choosing ECPP parameters differently, difficult prime numbers should
    be handled more gracefully. At least a reported difficult step now works
    reasonably fast. On the downside, certificates become a bit longer (by
    about 5% in the example), but I think this is set off by the smoother
    behaviour of the steps.
  - The preliminary ECPP step of computing primorials takes a bit less
    memory in the MPI version.
  - When ECPP certificates are output to a file, a second file in Primo
    format is created automatically.
  - ECPP certificate creation uses class field towers unconditionally.
  - An optional primality test is carried out before starting ECPP.
  - Fix the ECPP code on 32 bit platforms.
  - For larger numbers, the BPSW primality test of GMP is replaced by
    a Miller-Rabin test to base 2.
  - If the environment variable CM_ECPP_TMPDIR is set, files that do not
    change between different invocations of ecpp or ecpp-mpi are stored
    in and read back from that directory.
  - New command line options make it possible to compute only the first
    or only the second phase.
  - Phase 2 results are stored in any order as they come in, which
    requires the file format to change. Checkpoint files ending in .cert2
    from previous releases are not compatible.
  - Add an optional dependency on FLINT to speed up root finding in the
    second ECPP phase.
  - Decrease the trial division bound in ecpp-mpi, instead also distribute
    the numbers to be trial divided.
  - Backport an improvement to the half gcd from pari git, which
    considerably speeds up the Cornacchia steps.

Changes in version 0.4 ("Fitzebohnen"), released in May 2022:
  - increase minimal version number for mpfrcx to 0.6.3 and for
    pari to 2.11.
  - add decomposition of the class field into a tower of prime degree
    extensions
  - add a fastECPP implementation, including a version for MPI

Changes in version 0.3.1 ("Wurstebrei"), released in September 2020:
  - increase minimal version number for mpfrcx to 0.5 and for pari to 2.9.
  - many internal rewrites
  - bug fixes

Changes in version 0.3 ("Wurstebrei"), released in March 2016:
  - Features
    - use the baby-step giant-step algorithm of Enge-Hart-Johansson 2018 to
      compute the eta series
    - use a 2-system for j and a 6-system for gamma2, which increases the
      chances of staying in the same order for the numerator of the Weber
      function
  - Miscellanea
    - switch to GPL3+ license

Changes in version 0.2.1 ("Blindhühnchen"), released in March 2015:
  - Features
    - enable precision beyond 300000 bits
  - Dependencies
    - increase minimal version number for mpfr to 3.0.0, for mpc to 1.0.0
      and for pari to 2.7.0

Changes in version 0.2 ("Blindhühnchen"), released in February 2012:
  - Features
    - new class invariants: multiple eta quotients with '-imultieta'
    - double eta quotients with both primes >100
    - new parameter choice for double eta quotients yielding smaller class
      polynomials
    - slightly lower height bounds for double eta quotients
  - Bug fixes
    - printing of field and curve cardinality even without parameter "-v"
    - Weber polynomials work again (activated by "-iweber")
    - class polynomials for D=-4 and D=-16 work (no curve is constructed)
  - Dependencies
    - factorisation of class polynomials is done by pari instead of ntl
     
Version 0.1 ("Apfelkraut"), released in November 2009:
