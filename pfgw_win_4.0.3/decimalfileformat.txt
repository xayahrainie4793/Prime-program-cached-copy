PrimeForm/GW File format documentation version

Synapsis:

The DECIMAL format is used for handling long decimals values that are substrings
of a longer string without needing to specify the substring on each line.

****************************************************************************

File References:

This format is fairly limited.  It doesn't support variables like an ABC file.
In this file, the first line must start with the text "DECIMAL".  The decimal
value must be a string of digits which is terminated by a space, and end of line,
a tab, or the "//" characters. 

The subsequent lines of a DECIMAL file are decimal lengths.  PFGW will substring
the decimal value by that length to extract the number to be PRP tested.  Note that
PFGW cannot detect if the number is a special form that can be be primality tested,
so these numbers can only be PRP tested.

The sieving program pixsieve is the only software that creates files in this format.

The current maximum line length for an DECIMAL file is 5,000,100 bytes.

There are two formats for a DECIMAL file.  The first is used for PRP testing.

DECIMAL <some really long decimal value>
150
203
205
2890

This will test numbers of length 105, 203, 205, and 2890 from the decimal string.

The second format is used for factor verification

DECIMAL <some really long decimal value>
11 | 151
41 | 163

The first value is a suspected factor (likely a prime).  The second value provides 
the length of the decimal value that it divides.  PFGW will do a mod of the decimal
value by the factor.  If it returns "is Zero", then it has verified that the factor
is a valid factor of the decimal value.
